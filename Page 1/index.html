			<th><img src="Ibarra.jpg" alt="Ibarra" width="100"></td>
			<td>Juan Crisóstomo Ibarra y Magsalin (Ibarra)</td>
			<td>A wealthy young mestizo who has just returned to the Philippines after seven years of studying in Europe, Ibarra is sophisticated, highly esteemed, and very idealistic. The priests of San Diego all view him with great wariness on account of his highly liberal education and connections. His father, the equally idealistic Don Rafael, was labeled a subversive and a heretic by the corrupt priesthood and incarcerated, ultimately leading to his death. Ibarra hopes to create a school in San Diego in order to carry out his father's dreams and ideals, but he becomes entangled in conflicts with the church and is forced to flee San Diego as a result of a conspiracy led by the scheming Father Salví. In contrast to his more radical friend Elías, Ibarra generally wants to work within systems to reform the Philippines, rather than overthrow them, but he shifts towards Elías's beliefs as the novel progresses.</td>

		<tr>
			<th><img src="Maria.jpg" width="100"></th>
			<td>María Clara</td>
			<td>A woman of high social standing, she is thought to be the daughter of Capitan Tiago and goddaughter of Father Dámaso. She is actually the biological daughter of Father Dámaso, the product of a scandalous relationship between the old priest and Capitan Tiago’s wife. María Clara grew up alongside Ibarra and planned to marry him, but Father Dámaso disapproved of the union. After Ibarra is excommunicated from the church, her guardians set her up to be wed to Linares, a wealthy young man of Spanish descent, and she tries to go along with the plan to avoid hurting her father, the weak-willed Capitan Tiago. When Ibarra is put on trial for sedition, she is coerced into surrendering the letters Ibarra has sent her as evidence of his guilt. Ultimately, when she hears of Ibarra's apparent death, she refuses to marry Linares and joins a convent.</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<th><img src="Damaso.jpg" width="100"></th>
			<td>Father Dámaso</td>
			<td>Father Dámaso is an old, power-hungry, and shamelessly corrupt Spanish priest who has lived among the native Filipinos for nearly two decades. In spite of having spent all that time among them, the years have done nothing to endear him or develop any sympathy in him for his “flock.” He is deeply racist, as well as petty and vindictive, and he thinks nothing of using his considerable influence to ruin the lives of those who have slighted him, regardless of how small the offense is. He masterminded the death of Don Rafael Ibarra, then brazenly taunted the younger Ibarra. After he publically insults Ibarra's father, Ibarra attacks him and he excommunicates Ibarra from the church. He is also the godfather (and, in fact, the biological father) of María Clara, giving him influence over her relationship with Ibarra.</td>

		</tr>
<tr>
			<th><img src="Elias.jpg" width="100"></th>
			<td>Elías</td>
			<td>A mysterious character, Elías is a man on the run from the law who resents both the Spanish colonial government and the Catholic Church, despite his strong religious convictions. He crosses paths with the more temperate Ibarra when Ibarra bravely saves him from a crocodile. Elías uncovers a plot against Ibarra's life and works closely with him throughout the second half of the novel. He and Ibarra have several long conversations regarding the ethics of politics and governance, with Elias taking a more revolutionary stance.</td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th><img src="Crispin.webp" width="100"></th>
			<td>Crispín</td>
			<td>Father Dámaso is an old, power-hungry, and shamelessly corrupt Spanish priest who A young boy studying to be a church caretaker, Crispín and his brother Basilio work ceaselessly to send support money to their beleaguered mother, Sisa. Crispín is blamed for stealing money from the church coffers by the head sexton and is kept a virtual prisoner until the debt is paid. On the night that he and his brother were to visit their mother, the head sexton keeps them until the curfew, effectively barring the brothers from travelling. The head sexton beats him and he is never seen again afterward, presumably dying at the hands of the cruel head sexton, though another church official claims he escaped.</td>
